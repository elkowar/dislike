# Dislike

Do you, like,... dislike constantly saying "like" as much as I do?
Then, like,... you've come the right place!

This tool is like EXACTLY what you need to like stop saying "like".

## Setup
1. [Install the deepspeech library on your, like, system.](https://github.com/RustAudio/deepspeech-rs#quickstart)
2. Like,.... Download the [deepspeech model file (version 0.9.0)](https://github.com/RustAudio/deepspeech-rs#quickstart)
3. Run `dislike`, providing the, like, path to the like model file via the, like, `--model` argument.
4. Once you, like, have that, just like run the program, and have it, like, listen to what you say, and, like, react to it!

You can, like, run `dislike --help` to get some more, like, info on the command line arguments you
can, like, pass it.

Hope you like it!
