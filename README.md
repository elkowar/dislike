# Dislike

Do you, like,... dislike constantly saying "like" as much as I do?
Then, like,... you've come the right place!

This tool is like EXACTLY what you need to like stop saying "like".

Currently still, like, _very_ work in progress,
you'll need to download the deepspeech model file and put it into a folder called "deepspeech_model".
Like,... you can get the file from [here](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech/releases/download/v0.9.0/deepspeech-0.9.0-models.pbmm).
Once you, like, have that, just like run the program (in the directory that like,.. contains the `deepspeech_model` dir), and have it, like, shout at you!

Hope you like it!
