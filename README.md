# Dislike

Do you, like,... dislike constantly saying "like" as much as I do?
Then, like,... you've come the right place!

This tool is like EXACTLY what you need to like stop saying "like".

Currently still, like, _very_ work in progress,
you'll need to download the deepspeech model file and, like, provide the path to it to `dislike`
via the, like, `--model` argument.
Like,... you can get the file from [here](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech/releases/download/v0.9.0/deepspeech-0.9.0-models.pbmm).
Once you, like, have that, just like run the program, and have it, like, listen to what you say,
and, like, react to it!

You can, like, run `dislike --help` to get some more, like, info on the command line arguments you
can, like, pass it.

Hope you like it!
